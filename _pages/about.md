Biography
======
**Xiaoqun Wu(吴晓群)** is currently a Distinguished Professor at [the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/). She earned her Ph.D. in [Computational Mathematics from Wuhan University](https://maths.whu.edu.cn/) in 2005. Previously, she served as a Tier 3 Professor, Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics, and Deputy Director of the Complex Network Research Center at Wuhan University.

Research Interests
======
- **intelligent systems and networks**
- **cooperative control of multi-agent systems**
- **networked system reconstruction based on images/observational data/control**
- **analysis and control of information diffusion and disease transmission on networks**

Six projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (including a major research plan project) and a Distinguished Young Scholar project of Hubei Province have been led. Over **130** SCI journal papers have been published, with 97 as the first or corresponding author. Publications appear in top journals in control, such as the ***SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization*** and ***IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control***, as well as in leading interdisciplinary journals like ***Physics Reports*** (impact factor 29.9). Additionally, papers have been published in top computer science and engineering journals, including ***IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems***, ***IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics***, ***IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems***, and ***IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers***. Work has been cited over *3800* times in SCI, with nine papers recognized as ESI highly cited, and over 5600 times on Google Scholar, with an h-index of 42. Undergraduate students have been supervised to receive the first batch of National Natural Science Foundation of China projects for young students in basic research.
