#Biography

**Xiaoqun Wu(吴晓群)** is currently a Distinguished Professor at the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University. She earned her Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from Wuhan University in 2005. Previously, she served as a Tier 3 Professor, Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics, and Deputy Director of the Complex Network Research Center at Wuhan University.

#Research Interests
Research primarily focuses on **intelligent systems and networks**, including cooperative control of multi-agent systems, networked system reconstruction based on images/observational data/control, and analysis and control of information diffusion and disease transmission on networks. Six projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (including a major research plan project) and a Distinguished Young Scholar project of Hubei Province have been led. Over 130 SCI journal papers have been published, with 97 as the first or corresponding author. Publications appear in top journals in control, such as the SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization and IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, as well as in leading interdisciplinary journals like Physics Reports (impact factor 29.9). Additionally, papers have been published in top computer science and engineering journals, including IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, and IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers. Work has been cited over 3800 times in SCI, with nine papers recognized as ESI highly cited, and over 5600 times on Google Scholar, with an h-index of 42. Undergraduate students have been supervised to receive the first batch of National Natural Science Foundation of China projects for young students in basic research.
